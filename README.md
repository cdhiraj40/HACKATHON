# MENTIS-REM-HACKFIT-2021
## Inspiration
The reason we started making this application is because we thought that mental health is a serious problem, not only in our country but worldwide. Improving the mental health of anyone, anywhere is what brings us happiness, and that's the reason we made this app.

## What it does
Mentis Ram is an app solely built to help the mental health of the users. Firstly, the app can be used to track how your mental health been throughout the day and how much it has varied since the past few days. You can add journal entries every day. There's tasks included to help your mood, for now there's breathing exercise. You can even read different blogs to know more.

## How we built it
We built it using Kotlin in Android Studio and collaborated with each other using GitHub.

## Challenges we ran into
The greatest obstacle that we ran into was finding a relatively original idea that fit the theme of this hackathon, the other major obstacle was simply time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The accomplishment that we can say that we are proud of is that as beginners, we have learnt so much in the past 2 days. It was also extremely fun and of course, completing the application was our biggest achievement. We learnt about how collaboration can be such a sweet thing, and how learning from each other is so much more beneficial than learning alone.

## What we learned
We learnt a lot about mental health while researching for the app. In the technical side of it, we learnt how to collaborate and divide the work among ourselves. We learnt a lot of new concepts in android development.

## What's next for MENTIS REM
We're planning on adding a lot of new activities to improve mental health, more blogs. We're also planning on adding features that allow users to customize UI based on their preferences.
